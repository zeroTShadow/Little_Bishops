A bishop is a piece used in the game of chess which can only
move diagonally from its current position. Two bishops attack
each other if one is on the path of the other. In the figure
below, the dark squares represent the reachable locations for
bishop B1 from its current position. Bishops B1 and B2 are
in attacking position, while B1 and B3 are not. Bishops B2
and B3 are also in non-attacking position.

Given two numbers n and k, determine the number of
ways one can put k bishops on an n × n chessboard so that
no two of them are in attacking positions.

Input
The input file may contain multiple test cases. Each test
case occupies a single line in the input file and contains two
integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 8) and k (0 ≤ k ≤ n^2).
A test case containing two zeros terminates the input.

Output
For each test case, print a line containing the total number of ways one can put the given number of
bishops on a chessboard of the given size so that no two of them lie in attacking positions. You may
safely assume that this number will be less than 10^15
